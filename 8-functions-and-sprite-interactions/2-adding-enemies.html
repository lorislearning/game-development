<!-- Addding enemies -->
<p>You add enemy sprites the same way you add player sprites. If you wanted a player and an enemy to interact, you could add this code to your <code>updateFunction()</code>:</p>

<pre>
game.physics.arcade.overlap(player, baddie, hitBaddie, null, this);
</pre>

<p>The <code>hitBaddie()</code> function is run whenever a player sprite overlaps a baddie sprite.</p>

<p>Here is what the <code>hitBaddie()</code> function looks like. It's defined as a completely separate function, outside any of the pre-built Phaser functions:</p>

<pre>
function hitBaddie(player, baddie) {
  score = 0;
  text.text = 'Score: 0';
  player.kill();
}
</pre>
