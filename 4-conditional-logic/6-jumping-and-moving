<!-- Jumping and moving left/right -->

<p>If you want to jump and move left/right at the same time, you'll need to use different <code>if-else</code> statements. Remember, the program only chooses one option from every statement, so you'll need two different statements to get the spreite to jump up <em>and</em> move horizontally.</p>

<p>Here's the important change:</p>

<pre>
  function updateFunction() {
    if (leftKey.isDown) {
      player.body.velocity.x = -50;
    } else if (rightKey.isDown){
      player.body.velocity.x = 50;
    } else  {
      player.body.velocity.x = 0;
    }

    if (upKey.isDown && player.body.touching.down) {
      player.body.velocity.y = -100;
    }
  }

</pre>
