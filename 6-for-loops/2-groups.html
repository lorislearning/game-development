<!-- Groups -->

<p> Groups let you combine sprites together so that you can DRY up your Phaser code.Let 's say you wanted to group a set of sprites together. First you would need to create a variable for the group:</p>

<pre> var fruits; </pre>

<p>Then you would need to create the group in the <code>createFunction()</code>:</p>

<pre> fruits = game.add.group();</pre>

<p>Then, assuming you wanted to add physics, you can add it to the entire group at once:</p>

<pre> fruits.enableBody = true; </pre>

<p>Then you can create your sprites and add them to your group inside a loop. Suppose you wanted to create 3 sprites:</p>

<pre>
for(i=0; i<7; i++) {
  var item = fruits.create(i*30, 100, 'randomSprites ');
}
</pre>

<p>Finally, in the <code>updateFunction()</code>, you can collide a sprite with an entire group:</p>

<pre> game.physics.arcade.collide(player, fruits);</pre>
