<!-- Strings -->

<p>Strings are chunks of text that are surrounded by quotations. They look a lot like variables, except they can have spaces and need to be in either single or double quotations</p>

<pre>
  "A string!"
</pre>

<p>You can combine strings with the <code>+</code> sign:</p>

<pre>
  "peanut" + "butter"
</pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre>
  "peanutbutter"
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to add spaces if you need them:</p>

<pre>
  "peanut " + "butter" 
</pre>
