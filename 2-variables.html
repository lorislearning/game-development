<!-- Variables -->

<p>Variables are like properties, but they're not connected to an object. They're kind of like labeled storage boxes you can use to hold information or even chunks of code.</p> 

<p>You always want to create variables with the <code>var</code> keyword
:</p>

<pre>
  var name = "Arjun";
</pre>

<p>The contents of the variable is on the right side of the equals sign and the name of the variable is on the left side.</p>

<p>You can use variables to avoid repeating the same information. This hard to change code:</p>

<pre>
  alert("*poke*");
  alert("*poke*");
  alert("*poke*");
  alert("*poke*");
  aler("Are you annoyed yet?");
</pre>

<p>can become:</p>

<pre>
  annoy = "*poke*";
  alert(annoy);
  alert(annoy);
  alert(annoy);
  alert(annoy);
  aler("Are you annoyed yet?");
</pre>

<p>Now if you wanted to change the message, you only need to change one line of code instead of four lines.</p>
