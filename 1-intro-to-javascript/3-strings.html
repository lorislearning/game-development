<!-- Strings -->

<p>Strings are chunks of text, like words or sentences. They don't stand for any specific instruction - what you see is what you get - and they're one of the main data types in JavaScript. Strings look a lot like variables, but strings can have spaces and need to be surrounded by either single or double quotations</p>

<pre>
  "A string!"
</pre>

<p>You can combine strings with the <code>+</code> sign:</p>

<pre>
  "peanut" + "butter"
</pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre>
  "peanutbutter"
</pre>
<hr>
<p>But don't forget to add spaces if you need them!</p>

<pre>
  "peanut " + "butter" 
</pre>
