<!-- Numbers -->

<p>Numbers work pretty much like you'd expect. You don't need quotation marks like strings, and you can combine them using normal math symbols like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code></p>

<p>Adding two numbers together:</p>
<pre>
  7 + 11
</pre>

<p>Finding the area of a triangle:</p> 
<pre>
  (1/2) * base * height
</pre>
