<!-- JavaScript console -->
<p>The JavaScript console lets you look under the hood of your program and make some of the invisible stuff visible.</p>

<p>You can open the console in JS Bin by clikcing the <code>Console</code> button at the top of the screen. Or, if you're using Chrome, you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right click on the screen, click inspect, then click console</li>
  <li>In the menu bar, click View > Developer > JavaScript console</li>
</ul>

<p>You can type in any single line of JavaScript in the console and it will get processed. If other JavaScript files are already loaded up, you can use functions or variables from those files. </p>

Here's how to get console to print something:

<pre>
  console.log("A nut for a jar of tuna");
</pre>
