<!-- Animations -->

<p>You can create animations using spritesheets that have been loaded in.</p>
<p>Add this code in the <code>createFunction()</code>:</p>

<pre>
player = game.add.sprite(200, 100, 'troll');
player.animations.add('left', [4,5,6,7], 10, true);
</pre>

<p>Adding the sprite works the same as loading a regular image. Adding the animation is a little trickier, since it has multiple arguments. Here's what they mean:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A string that represents the name of the animation</li>
  <li>An array with the frames you want to use from the spritesheet. The frames go from left to right, like you're reading a book</li>
  <li>The speed of the animation. The higher this number, the faster the animation will play</li>
  <li>Whether or not the animation should lose</li>
</ol>

<p>You can run an animation (usually in the <code>updateFunction()</code>) with:</p>

<pre>
player.animations.play('left');
</pre>

<p>The only argument is the name of the animation you want to play:</p>

<p>You can stop all the animations on a sprite with:</p>
<pre>
player.animations.stop();
</pre>
